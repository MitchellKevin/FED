            <h2>
                Relentless progress. More power. More control. More exhilaration.</h2>
            <p>The 750S takes the McLaren ethos to a new apex. True to its DNA, it's the next-level supercar. Surpassing the benchmarks for performance, engagement and purity of response.<br><br>
                Defined by the relentless pursuit of lightness. Shaped by an innovation and expertise forged and honed in Formula 1™. The 750S is the living, breathing proof that – at McLaren – progress is never over. Every 1/100th of a second and each millimetre counts. Every limit is tested and surpassed.<br><br>
                The lightest and most powerful series production McLaren supercar ever. Delivering a stunning breadth of abilities that allows no compromise. The latest class-leading supercar from a bloodline with a 60-year history.</p>
